## We increase your resilience to future threats
If an organization processes personal data it must have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the personal data being processed. Consequently, a key element of any personal data security policy is being able, where possible, to prevent a personal data breach and, where it nevertheless occurs, to react to it in a timely manner. This requires measures to:

1.	Prevent a personal data breach
2.	Enable detection of a possible data breach
3.	React in a timely manner to a personal data breach

### Reducing the risk and fallout of personal data breaches
Organizations need to show they are in control of the data they hold, and this includes quickly identifying and reporting any high risk personal data breach. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the personal data being processed. They should take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, the scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. By using appropriate technical and organizational measures, personal data shall be processed in a manner to ensure the appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

### Preparing and maintaining a breach response plan
A personal data breach of any size is a crisis management situation, which could put an entire organisation at risk. Data security is not only an IT issue, it is a business risk, and breach response should involve people from a number of roles across the organisation, including operational, commercial, IT and a director or board member. Outside help can be sought to deal with legal, PR and forensic IT issues if needed. Dealing with a data breach will be a first for many employees. Planning for a breach is therefore essential; every organisation should have in place a breach response plan, and should designate, in advance, a breach response team which can be convened at short notice to deal with the crisis. Understanding the issues that arise in a breach situation, and practising managing a breach, are essential to effective breach response. Maintaining an up to data document to centralize breach response is essential. Failure to plan and practise increases the regulatory, litigation and reputation risk to the entire organisation.

An important part of a data breach response plan for an organisation is to assemble a list of external resources which could help reduce the negative consequences in the advent of a major breach. Time is of essence when a security incident has been identified. Assembling a list of available resources before an incident can help an organisation make informed decisions based on pertinent information.
