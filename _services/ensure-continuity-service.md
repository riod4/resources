## Don't expose your organization to avoidable risk 
Recovering trust is more costly than protecting private data. Preparing for possible privacy incidents provides an opportunity to identify gaps, and to develop and improve procedures that highlight an organizations accountability. It is important to ensure the objectives are measurable, with the key objective being to assure that every identifyable aspects of privacy breaches are analyzed, and procedures are defined to mitigate them. Doing the minimum and ‘getting away with it’ leads to a weak plan and no confidence in the face of a real incident. We’ll ensure you’re prepared and confident in the advent a privacy incedent affects your organization.

### Increase your resilience
If an organization processes personal data it must have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the personal data being processed. Consequently, a key element of any personal data security policy is being able, where possible, to prevent a personal data breach and, where it nevertheless occurs, to react to it in a timely manner. This requires measures to:

1.	Prevent a personal data breach.
2.	Enable detection of a possible data breach.
3.	React in a timely manner to a personal data breach.


### Reducing the risk of an incident
Organizations need to show they are in control of the data they hold, and this includes quickly identifying and reporting any high risk personal data breach. They need to enact appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk posed to the personal data being processed. They should take into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. By using appropriate technical and organizational measures, personal data should be processed in a manner to ensure the appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

### Maintaining a privacy incident response plan
A personal data breach of any size is a crisis management situation, which could put an entire organisation at risk. Personal data security is not only an IT issue, it is a business risk, and any breach response should involve people from a number of roles across the organisation, including operational, commercial, IT and a director or board member. Outside help can be sought to deal with legal, PR and forensic IT issues if needed. Dealing with a data breach will be a first for many employees. Planning for a breach is therefore essential; every organisation should have in place a breach response plan, and should designate, in advance, a breach response team which can be convened at short notice to deal with the crisis. Understanding the issues that arise in a breach situation, and practising managing a breach, are essential to effective breach response. Maintaining an up to date document to centralize breach response is essential. Failure to plan and practise increases the regulatory, litigation and reputation risk to the entire organisation. Recovering trust is difficult if a persoanl data breach is mishandled.

An important part of a data breach response plan for an organisation is to assemble a list of external resources which could help reduce the negative consequences in the advent of a major breach. Time is of essence when a security incident has been identified. Assembling a list of available resources before an incident can help an organisation make informed decisions based on pertinent information.

### Don't wait

The biggest mistake organizations of all sizes make is waiting until after an incident to figure out what to do next. It is unfortunate since, generally, an organization will not suffer simply because of a data breach. It will expose itself to negative consequences due to improperly responding to a breach, the result of not having a crisis plan in place. It’s important to not only build better defenses, but also better responses.
