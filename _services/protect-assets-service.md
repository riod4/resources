## Beyond compliance
A comprehensive privacy management program provides an effective way to satisfy regulators and assure compliance. But it is more than that. Done right, such a program helps foster a culture of privacy that builds trust, increases operational efficiency, and bottom-line results. Senior management support is vital in achieving business benefits when working on privacy compliance. When senior management provides the needed resources to ensure appropriate training and education, it sends a clear signal that privacy is vital to the organization. When an organization takes the position that privacy is vital to its operations by implementing a robust privacy management program, enhanced trust that is essential for customers and clients to engage with that organization follows. An organization that has a strong privacy management program enjoys an enhanced reputation that gives it a competitive edge. In the longer term, a privacy management program that is scaled to the organizationâ€™s needs will save money and make good business sense.

### Compliance fundamentals 
What should an organization do to ensure that it is handling personal information appropriately? How will it know that it is doing it right? How will it be able to demonstrate to its clients, partners and to the autorities that it has the capacity to comply and has complied with its legal obligations? An organizations which process personal data is required to implement and maintain privacy protection program. Policies and processes are needed, as well as role-specific privacy employee training. Contracts are required when organizations transfer personal information to third parties for processing, to ensure that the information in question is protected in a manner that is comparable to how the organization would protect it. Organizations are expected to have a an easy to understand public privacy policy in place, with clear procedures to respond to requests from individuals for access to (and correction of) their personal information. They need to be able to respond to complaints from individuals about how personal information is being used and protected, with regularly maintained documentation.

### Building trust  
Identifying where an organization can gain a competitive advantage while complying with local and international privacy laws should be a top priority for any organization looking to thrive in an increasingly data-driven environment. Boosting operational efficiency, increasing sales, and fostering trust, can all be gained by developing a tailored privacy management program. Identifying and purging sensitive, redundant, obsolete and trivial data of no business value lowers operational costs. Lean, fine-tuned databases of highly relevant data increase productivity and efficiency. Role-specific privacy training to relevant employee groups can increase growth and business opportunities. As western economies rebuild organisations around IT, they have to accept it is the heart of the company, not just a cost centre. Ensuring that personal data is safe will enable an organization to use data to offer services that customers want while increasing trust.
